0,"We love The Old Phoenix - this is the fourth time weâ€™ve visited in the last ten years or so. Itâ€™s secluded and quiet, and the swimming in the bay is sublime. If youâ€™re expecting five-star luxury, go somewhere else; this is a traditional family-run place, with a warm welcome, uncomplicated but delicious Cretan food and simple but comfortable, clean accommodation with wonderful views out over the Libyan Sea.","We love The Old Phoenix - this is the fourth time we've visited in the last ten years .

1,"What a disappointment. We have wanted to stay here for years but it was not a nice experience. Fine for a day at the beach and lunch at the taverna but donâ€™t expect friendly service, the waiters couldnâ€™t care less. And do not stay here! Rooms are tired, beds uncomfortable, bathrooms stink and they only empty the bins and clean every 3 days which really doesnâ€™t help the smell in the bathroom! No-one friendly or nice except the poor overworked cleaning lady.
 Go a bit further on and stay with Pablos at Akrogialis - so welcoming and gorgeous rooms. Boat or walk to Marmara beach for a nice day and lovely lunch at the taverna there also.","Rooms are tired,  beds uncomfortable,  bathrooms stink and they only empty the bins and clean every 3 days .

2,"We walked over to Fenix from Loutro and stayed the day on the beach by the Old Phoenix. Wonderful small stony beach, clean clear water and very quiet. Had lunch in the restaurant that was very good, fresh local ingredients and lovely service. Highly recommend other to come and see for themselves. If we come to Crete again we will come here and stay in one of their rooms.","We stayed on the beach by the Old Phoenix in Crete .

3,"The Old Phoenix was the low point of our two week vacation. Our room looked nothing like the photos. No art on the walls, fluorescent blue lights (and fluorescent reading lights, well, only one worked, that were brighter than the overheads), rough sheets, drain smell in unventilated bathroom, restaurant service dismissive. We slept terribly and would choose not coming to the area over staying here again. We stayed at many similarly priced/classed spots geared to hikers and of course none of them were fancy but this is the only one we have complaints about. Baffled by good reviews elsewhere on this site and in newspapers â€”Â maybe something has changed.","The Old Phoenix was the low point of our two week vacation .

4,"I had a fantastic time at Old-Phoenix!
 The beautiful beach on site provided the perfect backdrop for a relaxing vacation.
 
 The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making my stay even more enjoyable.
 The traditional regional Greek cuisine at the restaurant was delicious, allowing me to truly savor the flavors of Greece. The rooms were spotlessly clean and well-maintained, contributing to a comfortable and rejuvenating stay.
 I highly recommend Old-Phoenix and look forward to returning soon!","The traditional regional Greek cuisine at the restaurant was delicious .

5,"On the way from Marmara to Loutro I stopped for breakfast. I had a coffee and a yogurt, finally after 30 minutes the yogurt didn't arrive, so I went to the boss to pay for my coffee and everything was fine. Then the waiter came and although I did not ask for anything, he tried to justify the long wait and then said, ""If you were in a hurry, you should not have stoppedâ€. What a blow. I was not in a hurry and find it utterly disrespectful to wish I had not come to this place...very different from the natural hospitality I experienced in Crete. I hope to come back in the future and have a better experience.","On the way from Marmara to Loutro I stopped for breakfast.

6,"If you are looking for a get away from it all travelling experience then look no further. The location and view is absolutely stunning. We originally came here because itâ€™s a great base for walking but increasingly we like chilling out and relaxing on the beach.
 
 We like to walk the Aradena Gorge or go into Loutro , Marmara and beyond sampling the various tavernas along the way but most of all we love just â€œbeingâ€at The Pheonix.

7,"Amazing place with nice people running it! Very good (and affordable) connections by boat to the surrounding beaches â˜ºï¸
 
 The food was also amazing, skip the menu and just ask about what's on the grill today!
 
 Recommendation: take the boat to Marmara, walk up the Aradena gorge to Livaniana and then down to Finika again!

10,Excellent stay! Fantastic view from the veranda in the nice house. We got an upgrade to a bigger flat. Also we was able to check in 3 hours before expected.

11,"Owner was available and accommodating during enquiries, booking and arrival by email, phone and WhatsApp
 Spacious, simple air-conditioned room with equipped kitchenette, small bathroom, balcony with partial sea view and a small washing line. There are beach shoes for guests to borrow - very useful!! The house is at the top of Loutro and our room was on the top floor - altogether quite a climb but good exercise considering all the Greek Taverna food! Loutro is tiny so nothing is more than 5 minutes walk away.
 The couple who run the place are not always easily accessible but they are both lovely, super helpful, went out of their way to make us comfortable, Andreas did way beyond the necessary or expected.",,,,,,,"owner was available and accommodating during enquiries, booking and arrival by email, phone and WhatsApp. a simple air-conditioned room with equipped kitchenette, small bathroom, balcony with partial sea view and a small washing line. the house is at the top of Loutro so nothing is more than 5 minutes walk away. the couple who run the place are not always easily accessible but they are both lovely, super helpful, went out of their way to make us comfortable"

18,"Excellent! There are two main reasons - I believe there cannot be many more, actually. Firstly, the owners have been very helpful and trouble-less, they have given us a very nice room and coped with all our weird check-in times (due to unforeseeable weather-related circumstances); secondly the room itself was very nice, amazing view and a nice balcony.
 Internet also was working very well; all in all, an amazing place that makes you feel welcome and really ""on holidays"".

We also had a nice view from the balcony. The hosts were very friendly and gave us good recommendations for restaurants. Definitely recommend!",,,,,,," we spent 1 night here: we had a super nice room, spacious, very clean and nicely decorated. the hosts were very friendly and gave us good recommendations for restaurants."
