1,"What a disappointment. We have wanted to stay here for years but it was not a nice experience. Fine for a day at the beach and lunch at the taverna but don’t expect friendly service, the waiters couldn’t care less. And do not stay here! Rooms are tired,  beds uncomfortable, bathrooms stink and they only empty the bins and clean every 3 days which really doesn’t help the smell in the bathroom! No-one friendly or nice except the poor overworked cleaning lady.
Go a bit further on and stay with Pablos at Akrogialis - so welcoming and gorgeous rooms. Boat or walk to Marmara beach for a nice day and lovely lunch at the taverna there also.",1,4,"We have wanted to stay here for years but it was not a nice experience.

3,"The Old Phoenix was the low point of our two week vacation. Our room looked nothing like the photos. No art on the walls, fluorescent blue lights (and fluorescent reading lights, well, only one worked, that were brighter than the overheads), rough sheets, drain smell in unventilated bathroom, restaurant service dismissive. We slept terribly and would choose not coming to the area over staying here again. We stayed at many similarly priced/classed spots geared to hikers and of course none of them were fancy but this is the only one we have complaints about. Baffled by good reviews elsewhere on this site and in newspapers — maybe something has changed.",1,5,"The Old Phoenix was the low point of our two week vacation.

5,"On the way from Marmara to Loutro I stopped for breakfast. I had a coffee and a yogurt, finally after 30 minutes the yogurt didn't arrive, so I went to the boss to pay for my coffee and everything was fine.  Then the waiter came and although I did not ask for anything, he tried to justify the long wait and then said, ""If you were in a hurry, you should not have stopped”. What a blow.

The food was very disappointing. The quality was a typical tourist trap. If you had experiences with great affordable food in Crete you know when the restaurant doesn't care much about quality.

The workers in this place looked like they hated being there and were more worried to inspect who took which chair at the beach and who hasn't paid them yet instead of taking care of the restaurant.
