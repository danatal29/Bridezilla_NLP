Spacious, simple air-conditioned room with equipped kitchenette, small bathroom, balcony with partial sea view and a small washing line. There are beach shoes for guests to borrow - very useful!!

The couple who run the place are not always easily accessible but they are both lovely, super helpful, went out of their way to make us comfortable, Andreas did way beyond the necessary or expected.",5,6,"Owner was available and accommodating during enquiries, booking and arrival by email, phone and WhatsApp.
