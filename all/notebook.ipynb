The rooms were spotlessly clean and well-maintained, contributing to a comfortable and rejuvenating stay.\n","I highly recommend Old-Phoenix and look forward to returning soon!\n","We love The Old Phoenix - this is the fourth time we’ve visited in the last ten years or so. It’s secluded and quiet, and the swimming in the bay is sublime. If you’re expecting five-star luxury, go somewhere else; this is a traditional family-run place, with a warm welcome, uncomplicated but delicious Cretan food and simple but comfortable, clean accommodation with wonderful views out over the Libyan Sea.\n","The Old Phoenix was the low point of our two week vacation. Our room looked nothing like the photos. No art on the walls, fluorescent blue lights (and fluorescent reading lights, well, only one worked, that were brighter than the overheads), rough sheets, drain smell in unventilated bathroom, restaurant service dismissive. We slept terribly and would choose not coming to the area over staying here again. We stayed at many similarly priced/classed spots geared to hikers and of course none of them were fancy but this is the only one we have complaints about. Baffled by good reviews elsewhere on this site and in newspapers — maybe something has changed.\n","What a disappointment. We have wanted to stay here for years but it was not a nice experience. Fine for a day at the beach and lunch at the taverna but don’t expect friendly service, the waiters couldn’t care less. And do not stay here! Rooms are tired,  beds uncomfortable, bathrooms stink and they only empty the bins and clean every 3 days which really doesn’t help the smell in the bathroom! No-one friendly or nice except the poor overworked cleaning lady.\n","Go a bit further on and stay with Pablos at Akrogialis - so welcoming and gorgeous rooms. Boat or walk to Marmara beach for a nice day and lovely lunch at the taverna there also.\n","On the way from Marmara to Loutro I stopped for breakfast. I had a coffee and a yogurt, finally after 30 minutes the yogurt didn't arrive, so I went to the boss to pay for my coffee and everything was fine.  Then the waiter came and although I did not ask for anything, he tried to justify the long wait and then said, \"If you were in a hurry, you should not have stopped”. What a blow. I was not in a hurry and find it utterly disrespectful to wish I had not come to this place...very different from the natural hospitality I experienced in Crete. I hope to come back in the future and have a better experience.\n","If you are looking for a get away from it all travelling experience then look no further. The location and view is absolutely stunning. We originally came here because it’s a great base for walking but increasingly we like chilling out and relaxing on the beach.\n","\n","We like to walk the Aradena Gorge or go into Loutro , Marmara and beyond sampling the various tavernas along the way but most of all we love just “being”at The Pheonix.\n","\n","It’s a simple, quiet taverna but to us as soon as we arrive to the warm and friendly welcome it’s like coming home.\n","I recommend this place for those who love to swim in the warm Mediterrian sea in October and for those who love the smell of Crete in the autumn. This is definitely the best place ever for staying for hours on a small and beautiful beach …\n","We walked over to Fenix from Loutro and stayed the day on the beach by the Old Phoenix. Wonderful small stony beach, clean clear water and very quiet. Had lunch in the restaurant that was very good, fresh local ingredients and lovely service. Highly recommend other to come and see for themselves. If we come to Crete again we will come here and stay in one of their rooms.\n","Amazing place with nice people running it! Very good (and affordable) connections by boat to the surrounding beaches ☺️\n","\n","The food was also amazing, skip the menu and just ask about what's on the grill today!\n","\n","Recommendation: take the boat to Marmara, walk up the Aradena gorge to Livaniana and then down to Finika again! Amazing little hike\n","Actually, you can read it all at the homepage of The Old Phoenix, it is a very good and precise description. |It is a really nice, very laid back place, beautifully situated in the bottom of the small bay of Finix. The rooms are small and …\n","When the small boat takes you into Finix Bay it’s taking you back to how Greece used to be before mass tourism. A wonderfully relaxing traditional place with lots of outdoor activity in the surrounding mountains\n","Didn't stay at the hotel but did eat at the restaurant. Service was bad, food just ok. Do yourself a favor and take a 20 minute walk west and eat at Nikos Small Paradise instead. They actually appreciate your business.\n","So now I'm back again at Old Phonix. If you want details you can read my review from 2017, because it hasn't changed much. And that is what's so lovely about it. A beautiful building in a beautiful place. Very well kept, painted in …\n","A most beautiful and relaxing place, very friendly atmosphere and the best views of the landscape you can get! This family run hotel is very unique, with great food, very nice people - the most authentic greek impression possible. We visit for more than 20 years and hope for many more holidays in this place in the years to come. Go and try yourself! Its worth it...\n","Food was regular and good, typical greek and fresh. The location sea view was very quiet, fresh, not crowded at all. A pity that the service was not at the same level. It seemed that the waiter , probably even the owner, was not really willing to care about customers.\n","It's our small paradise on earth. We  came again with our teenagers for a perfect week vacation. Not first and for sure we will come again. Rooms are very simple with a perfect sea view and a balcony. The beach is quiet, clear water. The restaurant is the best in Greece. All fresh tasty homemade food, even the goat cheese they make here. Lovely family and the best waiters.Yamas\n","I was a spectacular road but also a «hard drive» down the mountain -the last km was on a dirt road. But the view both getting to  the Taverna and sitting at the Taverna was very nice. The Mossaka and the Greek salad tasted very good.\n","My wife and I recently stayed at the Old Phoenix and had the most wonderful stay. If you're looking for simple relaxation - sunbathing, reading, walking and swimming this is a great place. The weather was beautiful as was the scenery.
