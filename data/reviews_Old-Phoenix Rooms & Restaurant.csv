Amazing place with nice people running it! Very good (and affordable) connections by boat to the surrounding beaches ☺️ …,5,7
When the small boat takes you into Finix Bay it’s taking you back to how Greece used to be before mass tourism. A wonderfully relaxing traditional place with lots of outdoor activity in the surrounding mountains,5,6
I recommend this place for those who love to swim in the warm Mediterrian sea in October and for those who love the smell of Crete in the autumn. This is definitely the best place ever for staying for hours on a small and beautiful beach …,5,12
"Didn't stay at the hotel but did eat at the restaurant. Service was bad, food just ok. Do yourself a favor and take a 20 minute walk west and eat at Nikos Small Paradise instead. They actually appreciate your business.",1,7

I was a spectacular road but also a «hard drive» down the mountain -the last km was on a dirt road. But the view both getting to  the Taverna and sitting at the Taverna was very nice. The Mossaka and the Greek salad tasted very good.,4,12
"Food was regular and good, typical greek and fresh. The location sea view was very quiet, fresh, not crowded at all. A pity that the service was not at the same level. It seemed that the waiter , probably even the owner, was not really willing to care about customers.",3,12
"It's our small paradise on earth. We  came again with our teenagers for a perfect week vacation. Not first and for sure we will come again. Rooms are very simple with a perfect sea view and a balcony. The beach is quiet, clear water. The …",5,48

"You'll pass this place on your hike along this stunning coast. The taverna looks inviting and as modern as Tesla, well at least in these parts. I sat at 1205pm and was told the kitchen doesn't open for 25 minutes...have some stuffed …",3,12
Beautiful location but if you want a wonderful quiet romantic time don't come when there's a Yoga group here for a week and using amplified vocals on the harbour during the day...Food and Drink fine but noise levels not what the publicity suggests!,3,12
The strong point of this hotel is its unique location and wonderful views.    The owners are friendly but my bathroom smelled of drains and there was poor grouting with dark brown stains.     The bedrooms were only serviced once every three …,3,96

Of particular note:
The always friendly head waiter Bio gives competent advice and anticipates every wish.",5,5

In short, a little corner of paradise",5,6

With breathtaking sea views.",5,24

We stayed in this small bay after walking the trail starting from Loutro. The walk is worth it for the landscape and is not demanding if you don't do it during the hottest hours (it's all in the sun). The beach is small but equipped and the …,5,72
"The place has charm, it is unique. Very difficult to reach, we went there by car but the road is challenging (we recommend a 4x4 for safer travel). The beach isn't that great (the water was full of oil). The restaurant is decent, prices are …",4,120

"Reached by boat or a 7-minute walk along a goat path from the lively port of Loutro, the small bay with the only hotel/restaurant feels like an enchanted place. A place of peace, relaxation, good food and friendly gastronomy. And a good starting point for hikes, especially to the nearby Aradena Gorge.",4,96
"Remote but accessible, family-friendly and warm, you eat very good traditional Greek cuisine at an affordable price. Close to marmara and loutro without having the disadvantages.

"at first I thought I would feel like a prisoner of this place which is a bit difficult to reach and leave, but I soon realized that it is the starting point to go to Marmara, Sweet waters and of course Loutro. The quality of the food is …",4,120
"Secluded, pleasant, only accessible on foot or by boat - great. The food is good, after a while there's a bit of a lack of variety (but that's generally the case in Crete; fish, feta and tomatoes then become a bit bland) but a great tip for …",4,48
"Thank you for the always very pleasant welcome and service at the Old Phoenix!|Very good grilled sardines. We also come back for the dakos, and always a free raki at the end of the meal - have a good visit and hope you like this place, the beach is also nice",5,12

Fantastic! Food comes straight from the sea for you. To get there by car it is better to rent a 4X4 :-) By car it is doable if you are not afraid of heights and can drive well and quietly. By boat or on foot it is a lot easier and is a …,5,96
"Quiet place, ideal for a relaxing holiday. The road to get there is a bit long, unpaved and bumpy. Friendly and helpful owners, slightly rustic waiters (all male). Clean rooms. A somewhat Spartan place, not as refined as it seems from the outside. ""Seaside refuge"" environment. Advised",4,96
"either by boat or with an off-road vehicle but then an enchanting place. I just ate with a breathtaking view of a cobalt blue sea. Mediterranean atmosphere like you don't meet anymore, simple people like those of the past. good food and unique mountain honey.",4,120

"Close to the Aradena and Loutro gorges and on the water's edge, this place is ideal for those who want to stop time. The welcome is very friendly, the staff ready to find solutions for our comfort. The rooms are simple. I recommend the walk from there to Hora Sfakion, on the mountainside, then return by ferry to Loutro.",5,72
A very nice place to relax. The rooms are old but the view and proximity to the clear sea are beautiful. The food in the evening is also great. The breakfast didn't convince us.,4,48
"07.10.2019. I didn't eat there or stay there. I only passed through it while hiking but I actually found that it is an excellent landmark, very precisely located by Google, for hiking either towards Marmara beach to the west or towards the …",5,48
"Nicely located restaurant, unfortunately the service is not the best. The waiter extremely
musty and not exactly friendly. 👎 …",4,24

Old Phoenix is ​​definitely recommended the hotel and the view are fantastic and the service 5/5 the waiter is very funny and nice Bio I have been there many times now and I love it,5,10
You have to be motivated to get there because there is no road but a steep and winding track... The game is worth the effort,5,10
"Scammers / Liars / Απατεώνες - Αvoid this place, its dirty, no charm and waiters stare at you like rapists. To be avoided at all costs: dirty, waiters who complain and the boss who cheats on room prices at the start. Να το αποφύγετε. …",1,72
"We arrived at 7 p.m. without reservation, the boss gave us a room and served us a very good meal, very welcoming and respectful staff. The next day we went to Loutro on foot, a very good path connecting the hotel and Loutro. We will stay again if we come to the area",5,48

Absolutely have!
Is unique, is my paradise!!!",5,72

"Nice service, good food, friendly people, good rooms and beautiful scenery. Definitely worth a visit 👍 …",5,12
"getting here is easy by boat from Chora Sfakion and much more difficult by car by taking a detour - the road is very narrow and intended for off-road vehicles, much worse than on Balos. But the water here is crystal clear, the boats seem to float in the air.",4,60
"If you want time and peace for reflection, this hotel is excellent. They are all alone in a bay and have an excellent restaurant. There are relatively few tourists and you have access to hikes in the mountains, as well as in a large gorge. …",5,120

Obviously the setting is magnificent but it is a real shame that the managers and staff are not welcoming.... they don't care! if you go there check the price of your nights when you arrive. Disappointing.,1,72
"Arrived on a warm June evening by sea.

"Just, perfect, very friendly staff, comfortable rooms, delicious food, very comfortable beaches, only drawback, in the morning, the local taxi boat warms up its engine and during breakfast, it's not the most pleasant, but, fault quickly erased when you get up around 10 a.m., so go for it, it's worth it",4,48

"Picturesque view, sitting right on the water. Just had something to drink in the restaurant. But you can settle here.",5,48
"It is a resort in South Crete. The rooms are clean although many of them are very old. The owners are helpful and quite willing. The food is very good but expensive! I justify the cost as the food is brought in by boat, but I guess a lot of it is home grown. The view from the rooms is perfect!!!",4,120
