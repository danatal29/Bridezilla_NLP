Excellent stay! Fantastic view from the veranda in the nice house. We got an upgrade to a bigger flat. Also we was able to check in 3 hours before expected. The owner was very helpful and service oriented. Kitchen was well equipped and it was only 50 meters to the local store.,5,5
"Owner was available and accommodating during enquiries, booking and arrival by email, phone and WhatsApp
Spacious, simple air-conditioned room with equipped kitchenette, small bathroom, balcony with partial sea view and a small washing line. There are beach shoes for guests to borrow - very useful!! The house is at the top of Loutro and our room was on the top floor - altogether quite a climb but good exercise considering all the Greek Taverna food! Loutro is tiny so nothing is more than 5 minutes walk away.
The couple who run the place are not always easily accessible but they are both lovely, super helpful, went out of their way to make us comfortable, Andreas did way beyond the necessary or expected.",5,6
"Just steps from the beach Villa Niki was spacious and clean, nice balcony overlooking Loutro. Bed was comfortable and air conditioning was a god send as it was hot. Make sure you say hello to Andreas who was very helpful, Every morning he …",5,12

"This is a very clean and friendly ""Rooms to let"". It is renovated offering spacious and beutiful rooms. Nice for families. The view is ok, but there are some disturbing items on nearby terraces. It is very close to the beach, perhaps 1-2 minutes walking distance. Suggested",5,24

"Excellent! There are two main reasons - I believe there cannot be many more, actually. Firstly, the owners have been very helpful and trouble-less, they have given us a very nice room and coped with all our weird check-in times (due to unforeseeable weather-related circumstances); secondly the room itself was very nice, amazing view and a nice balcony.
Internet also was working very well; all in all, an amazing place that makes you feel welcome and really ""on holidays"". Very recommended.",5,48
"We spent 1 night here:  we had a super nice room, spacious, very clean and nicely decorated. Even we didn’t have time to eat in, we noticed that it had all the tools needed in the small kitchen. We also had a nice view from the balcony. The hosts were very friendly and gave us good recommendations for restaurants. Definitely recommend!",5,48
"Not a very Nice owner. We Waited 20 minutes in the Crete heatwave, july2021. He wasn’t even bothered. He didn’t help with our luggage. There wasn’t even a bottle of water available (which is common for Crete!). The room was hot on our arrival. Just a bit of a plonker to be honest and not very helpful.",1,24
"My husband and I stayed at Villa Niki during our honeymoon in Crete. The room was great, reasonably priced, very roomy and the view was great! The kitchenette was so handy and there is a little grocery store just round the corner, so we …",5,48
"Unprofessional, super opportunistic service, resulting in horrible customer experience. Completely against the values of Greek hospitality and a real shame for the Greek tourism industry, especially in Crete. As a Greek national, I deeply regret bringing my freind to  this place",1,24

"If you want to spend a short or long time in Loutro, this accommodation, run by a married couple, is a good home. The view of the bay and the town is magical. The rooms are clean and spacious and usually have a balcony with a parasol. Quiet air conditioning units are available. The bed mattress is comfortable. We had a spacious studio with a larger balcony and a small kitchenette.

"A little disappointment. Villa Niki is not exactly as expected from the booking photos. Yes, the bed is very large, the small balcony, also with solar panels in front, allows you to glimpse the beautiful panorama... but the room was still occupied at 12 and it was delivered to us in a hurry after about 1 hour... but then when we had to leaving we had to vacate the rooms early in the morning and put our suitcases in a storage room. The room is large but not very well looked after: stained shower, broken towel rail, broken wardrobe etc.
The owners are not welcoming. For example, you can only pay in the evening from.... to.. Who knows?",3,48

"Amazing view of the beach, especially when it has a bright moon!! Very romantic balcony! Comfortable room, with a nice bathroom! The lighting of the space needs improvement. The sconces above the bed are not convenient, while the rest of the lamps do not provide sufficient lighting. But as an option I would do it again!",3,60
