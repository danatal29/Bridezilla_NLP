The quality was a typical tourist trap.\\nIf you like walking you can discover a lot in the south western Crete.\\nThe food is very good, fresh daily, ask for the bean soup,it\\'s the best.\\nThe taverna looks inviting and as modern as Tesla, well at least in these parts.\\nThe guy serving was lovely an owner. He was as happy to see me as he would be his ex wife.\\nBeautiful location but if you want a wonderful quiet romantic time don\\'t come when there\\'s a Yoga group here for a week and using amplified vocals.\\nFood and Drink fine but noise levels not what the publicity suggests!\\nThe strong point of this hotel is its unique location and wonderful views.\\nMy bathroom smelled of drains and there was poor grouting with dark brown stains.\\nAs one cannot put lavatory paper down the loo but you have to use a bin, this was pretty unhygienic.\\nNice and calm place, less traffic than in Loutro.\\nWe had a very nice lunch with a Cretan salad and Mousaka.
